Known issues
------------
  - If you click and hold on a button then move the cursor away before
    releasing, it will not cancel the button event. In fact, it doesn't matter
    where on the panel you click on after that. It will still trigger the
    button event as if you had clicked on the button. I'm not sure how to fix
    this, and the problem doesn't appear to be exclusive to this applet either.
  - The maximize button can be stuck in the highlighted state occasionally.
    This happens when the button changes to the restore button or vice versa
    shortly after the cursor has been over it. Mousing over the button will fix
    the problem if it crops up.
