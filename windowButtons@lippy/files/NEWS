Cinnamon Window Buttons changelog:

Version 1.0 - 2012/05/10
------------------------
  - Initial release.
  - Port to Cinnamon Shell and rewrite as an applet. This has advantages and
    disadvantages. The main advantage is that the buttons can now be moved
    anywhere; they can even be on the bottom panel. The disadvantage is that
    the buttons have to be together, so it's no longer possible to have buttons
    on both sides of the panel at the same time.
  - Make maximize button dynamic. It will now turn into a restore button when
    the active window is maximized if onlymax is disabled. If onlymax is
    enabled, it will be a restore button when any window in the workspace is
    maximized. Add icons for the restore button.
  - Add support for hotswapping of themes.
  - Improve hideonnomax functionality. It now hides the buttons when the active
    window is not maximized when onlymax is not set. Previously the option
    would have had no use in this configuration.
  - Ignore buttons to the left of the titlebar due to the buttons having to be
    together. I hope to restore this functionality as best as I can for a
    future version.
  - Remove functionality where the buttons can control windows that are not
    active. I felt this behaviour was inconsistent and didn't offer any real
    use so I don't see any negative impact on removing it. This also fixes a
    bug where windows from other workspaces can be controlled when onlymax is
    set and the current workspace has no active windows.
  - Add highlighted and pressed states for the default theme.
  - Update Ambiance and Radiance themes to match those of Ubuntu Precise.
  - Button events are triggered after the button is released, rather than
    clicked on.
  - Match button tooltips with those of Cinnamon.
  - Clean up code.
