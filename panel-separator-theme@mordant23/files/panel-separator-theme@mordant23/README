Panel Separator (Theme) applet is a version of the Panel Separator applet for the Cinnamon desktop. The implementation is made by using creating a themeable applet. This version of Panel Separator is for people who prefer to use a theme to modify the separator. There is a sample stylesheet, the contents of which can be copied on to your theme. 

The Panel Separator (Theme) takes care of the problem Panel Separator (Icon) had with the extra padding. With Panel Separator (Theme) you can decide how much space you want around the separator with a simple modification of the width property.

There is a downside. You have to muck around with themes. If you change your theme often, this may get annoying.

HOW TO INSTALL
==============
In the future there will be nice automated installations, but for now use the amazing power of extraction to copy this folder to the applet directory.

For an individual install, extract to:

~/.local/share/cinnamon/applets

For a system wide install, extract to:

/usr/share/cinnamon/applets

Copy the contents of stylesheet.sample to the end of your theme's css file.

If you really want to, you can just just change the name to 'stylesheet.css'. I wouldn't recommend that, because then you'll have to 'Alt+F2', 'r' everytime you change themes. (Default theme is loaded before applet stylesheets).

Remember: DON'T FORGET TO 'ALT+F2' 'r' to load the applet.

HOW TO INSTALL MULTIPLE SEPARATORS ON THE CINNAMON PANEL
=================================================
As of Cinnamon 1.3.1, you can only have one instance of each applet on the panel. But you want to have a lot of separators to make sense of your crowded panel? DO NOT FEAR.

Just copy and paste this applet multiple times in the applet directory and make the following changes:

1.Give each copy of the applet a unique name. A really easy way to do that is to rename them 'panel-separator-icon1@mordant23", 'panel-separator-icon2@mordant23', ..., 'panel-separator-iconN@mordant23 where N is the number of separators you want on your panels.

2. For each copy of the applet, change the "uuid" field in the metadata.json file so that it's the same name as the folder. For example, change:

"uuid": "panel-separator-theme@mordant23"

to

"uuid": "panel-separator-themeN@mordant23"

In the future I'll write a snazzy script to do it automatically for you, but the future is not today.

MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ADD THE .PANEL-SEPARATOR TO YOUR THEME'S CSS
=================================================
You can just cut and paste the contents of stylesheet.sample to your current theme if you want. Depending on your theme, you may want to change the background color, width, border color, provide a background image, etc.

If you don't like theming, you can change the background color by modifying:

background: rgba(255,255,255,.5);

The 255,255,255 is the rgb color (Red, Green, Blue) and the .5 gives the opacity. 0 is completely transparent and 1 is fully opaque.

Suppose you just want to add some extra spacing around the separator. Then all you have to do is change the padding property.

For example changing the sample style to

.panel-separator {
    width: 1px;
    padding: 5px;
    border: 0px; 
    background: rgba(255,255,255,.5);
}

Will add 5px of spacing on both sides of the separator. I won't go into any more of the theming possibilities. Google is your friend and just try changing the theme. The worst that will happen is that you'll cause the end of the universe.
