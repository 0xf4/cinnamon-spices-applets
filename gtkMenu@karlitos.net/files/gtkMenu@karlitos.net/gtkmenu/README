README for the program "myGtkMenu"

The purpose of myGtkMenu is to read a description file and display a menu.
This program requires GTK+-2.4.x (or later) libraries.

You should have received these files:

myGtkMenu
myGtkMenu-64
TestMenu.txt
main.c
Makefile
License.txt
README
and the directory gnome-icons (contains a few test icons)


INSTALLATION:

(1) If you are running 64-bit linux, rename myGtkMenu-64 as myGtkMenu.

(2) Copy myGtkMenu, TestMenu.txt, and gnome-icons to a convenient directory.
    I keep mine in ~/bin for easy backup and restore.

(3) Check file permissions to make sure that myGtkMenu is executable and
    TestMenu.txt is readable.

(4) Using TestMenu.txt as a guide, create a new menu description file
    (here called newMenu.txt).

(5) Run "myGtkMenu newMenu.txt" in a terminal window to check for errors.

(6) Create a launcher on the desktop or on a panel that runs
    "myGtkMenu newMenu.txt".


The latest version of myGtkMenu (1.2.1) should work with Gnome keyboard
shortcuts (hot keys). To setup a hot key in Gnome, use gconf-editor.

(1) Using gconf-editor, place the command
    /*PATH*/myGtkMenu  /*PATH*/newMenu.txt
    at
    apps -> metacity -> keybinding_commands -> command_3

(2) Assign the corresponding hot key at
    apps -> metacity -> global_keybindings -> run_command_3
